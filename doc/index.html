    <p>Lyd is currently mostly a programmers toy, out of the box at the moment
    lyd contains a mediocre autogenerated approximation of an OPL2 FM
    synthesizer in its patch set. When you launch lyd you can use it
    as a synthesizer with an attached MIDI keyboard or with MIDI sequencers
    supporting ALSA midi.</p>

    <p>Pass an instrument definition to the -i argument to reprogram MIDI
    program 0. This allows testing one-off synthesizers easy from the
    commandline.</p>

    <tt>lyd -i 'square(hz + square(40)) * adsr(0.2,0.2,0.8,0.4)'</tt>
    </p>

    <p>Add -w 0.5 -d 0.3 to add a random scale walker that plays a new random
    note nearby on the scale every 0.5seconds that lasts for 0.3seconds, this
    provides a way to get an idea how a patch sounds.</p>

    <p>The OSC support needs rethinking, and probably re-integration with the
    midi support. Allowing repatching instruments used with MIDI on the fly
    from OSC.</p>

    <h3><a class='jump' href='#top' title='jump to top'>⇡</a>
      <a name='programmers' href='#programmers'>Lyd for programmers</a></h3>

    <p>You can use lyd as an audio canvas, or general signal processing
    engine.  Lyd is writtene to make sure it is easy to incorporate in other
    projects, either by linking to a shared lyd installation or for static
    inclusion by copying the source of the core (See <a href='#license'></a>).
    </p>

    <p>
    Lyd allows instantiated programmed voices, <em>LydVoice</em> that render
    sound in real time. The voices are defined in the lyd language using
    constants, variables, arithmetic, noise, oscillators, envelopes and PCM
    data sources. 
    
    Voices can instantiated right now or queued with sample precision.
    Voices can be killed to immediately stop playback or released allowing <a
      href='reference.html?#adsr'>ADSR</a>s to control the amplitude of your
    voice and provide smooth volume scaling, multiply by adsr(0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0);
    for immediate full volume and immediate cut-off.  When a voice is released
    all ADSRs will enter their release phase and decay to 0.0; silence. Silent
    voices are detected and automatically killed.</p>

    Variables in the programs (all strings that are not numbers or recognized
    as keywords in the <a href='reference.html'>language reference</a>) can be
    manipulated in realtime or programmed with time/value key frames with
    per-key interpolation. Realtime control is not sample accurate, but
    accurate to the number of samples requested from lyd in a set of samplings

    Controlling variables allows specifying or modifying in real-time the hz,
    filters, volume, reverb or similar, of multiple oscillators and filters,
    providing a natural and automatic bridge between lyd and C or any scripting
    language potentially wrapping the lyd API.

    <p>There is a MIDI playback API, where timing is broken, (for testing midi
    playback for testing/development, the daemon and its ALSA midi support is
    currently used. If this feature is used in a game a possible workaround is
    to statically include lyd (lyd is small so it would perhaps be a good idea
    anyways) and tweak the tempo logic in the midi decoder source.</p>

    <p>Directly processing a lyd voice allows running the virtual machine
    on user provided input/output buffers, allowing to easily wrap the core
    vm with minimal inderection.</p>

    <p>See the examples for illustrations of the above concepts.

    <a href='http://pippin.gimp.org/git/lyd/tree/examples'>examples in the source tree.</a>.
    <!--(note to self: would be good to allowing interpolation of real-time specified variables
    to avoid artifacts)-->.

    <p>Running under Fedora 13, with Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU L9400 @
    1.86GHz, lyd is able to render the following number of concurrent voices
    for the following programs. Respectively with ALSA and with ALSA through
    pulse-audio, both of them using the only period size ALSA seems to
    accept with my soundcard.</p>

    <p>The following is a technical summary of what lyd actually is, it is not
    neccesary to understand any of it to make use of lyd's language and
    API. But is useful for people interested in how lyd technically works as well
    as people pondering to help extend lyds capabilities.</p>

    <p>Lyd uses a <a href='http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html'>Top
      Down Operator Precedence</a> parser to generate an AST for the lyd
    expression. This parser form part of the <a
      href='http://pippin.gimp.org/git/lyd/tree/lyd/lyd-compiler.c'>lyd-compiler.c</a>,
      which generates op-codes for the <em>lyd vm</em>. The compiler builds a
      <em>LydProgram which</em> is a struct defining op-codes and the values of 
      their dependencies.
    </p>

    <p>The op-codes in compiled LydPrograms are in processing order and
    arguments to the opcodes are either be positive literals or negative
    integer back-pointers to the outputs of preceding opcodes.</p>

    <p>When a compiled program is instantiated to an active LydVoice it
    becomes an array of <a href='http://pippin.gimp.org/git/lyd/tree/lyd/lyd-private.h#n65'>LydOpState</a>
    entires, a struct containing the
    opcode and a processing context with local argument and output storage.
    </p>

    <p>LydOpstate contains small <em>chunk buffers</em>.
    The chunk buffers are 128 samples long and 16-byte aligned, the op has one
    such buffer for the output and for arguments (allowing arguments to be
    interpolated over time with sample accuracy).  The chunk buffers makes it
    possible to use gcc autovectorization using -ftree-vectorize for the code
    execute for the op-codes.
    </p>

    <p>The execution of the vm is walking a linked list of processing
    states over a dispatch switch.
    <pre>
    for(state=vm-&gt;state;state-&gt;op != LYD_NONE; state = state-&gt;next)
      switch (state-&gt;op)
        {
          /* handling op codes and dispatch relevant code */
        }
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>The op-codes of lyds virtual machine, and the functions and operators of
    the lyd language are all defined in
    <a href='http://pippin.gimp.org/git/lyd/tree/lyd/lyd-ops.inc'>lyd-ops.inc</a>
    Op-codes added following the pattern in this file are expanded as different
    macros when included in various parts of the source, providing both
    en enum, cases for the dispatch switch, integration with the compiler
    and the and the <a href='reference.html'>language reference</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Each render thread operates has it's own queue of voices to compute and
    an associated mutex and condition to manage execution flow without any busy
    waiting.
